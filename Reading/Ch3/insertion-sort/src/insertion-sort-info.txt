insertion sort

>Algorithm proceeds by considering one element at a time, placing
the element in the correct order relative to those before it
>We start with the first element in the array, which sorts itself
>For the next element, if it is smaller than the first, we swap them
>For the third element, swap it leftward until it is in its proper order relative to the first two elements
>Continue this method with the fourth, fifth, and so on, until whole array is sorted

 Algorithm InsertionSort(A):
    input: An array A of n comparable elements
    output: The array A with elements rearranged in nondecreasing order
    for k from 1 to n-1 do
        Insert A[k] at its proper location within A[0], A[1],...,A[k}
