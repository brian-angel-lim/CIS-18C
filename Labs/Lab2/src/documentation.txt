=== Cesar Cipher ===
> Type of substitution cipher
>Takes the alphabet and shifts it over by a number of values
>Example:

(by 2 values)
- A B C D E F G H I
- C D E F G H I J K

- HELLO (normal)
- JGOOQ (cesar)

(by 7 values)
- A B C D E F G H I -- Alphabet - E(plainText) -> cipherText
- H I J K L M N O P -- Shifted by 7 - D(cipherText) -> plainText
- Wanted to say Hi, might be translated to AB

> Does not offer any information security and can be broken by hand

plainText -> encrypt(plainText, shift) -> cipherText
